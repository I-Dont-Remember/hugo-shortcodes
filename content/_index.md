Bringing the many shortcodes I've run into over the years into one place so I can easily find what I'm looking for, and hopefully have a few lucky folks stumble upon it and save themselves the search as well.

The majority of the shortcodes should be plug n play. As I add new shortcodes, I attempt to prevent any dependency on specific CSS/JS frameworks from leaking in. If there is a dependency, it will be clearly marked.

Inspired by {{< new_tab_link title="UseHooks" url="https://usehooks.com" >}} and comments like these matching my thoughts on the matter - [_"...i need is a pool of shortcodes to “steal” from"_](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/table-in-markdown/11434/7).

[Contributions💻, feedback 🗣️, or issues 🙊](https://github.com/I-Dont-Remember/hugo-shortcodes) are welcome, I am by no means a Hugo expert.
