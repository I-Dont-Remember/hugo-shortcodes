Bringing the many shortcodes I've run into over the years into one place so I can easily find what I'm looking for, and hopefully have a few lucky folks stumble upon it and save themselves the search as well. Inspired by {{< new_tab_link title="UseHooks" url="https://usehooks.com" >}}.

Contributions💻 or edits ✍ welcome, I am by no means a Hugo expert.
